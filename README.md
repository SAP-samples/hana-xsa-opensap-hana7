Software Development on SAP HANA (Update Q1/2019)
openSAP HANA7 Course Exercise Materials

## Course Summary
With the delivery of SAP HANA 2.0, we see many new features in both the underlying SAP HANA infrastructure and in the custom development aspects of SAP HANA native development.

Although we have two previous courses that focused on these new technologies – SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA to develop both HDI (SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure) and XSA (SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model) – they could only cover the basics due to so much new functionality. In this course, we’ll start from the assumption that students are familiar with the basics of the previous courses. This will allow us to dive deeper on key topics from real world applications. We’ll also cover new functionality added in SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 03, especially the evolution of the core programming model in XSA.

Developers taking this course should be able to get up to speed quickly and begin leveraging these new features to enhance their own productivity, as well as tap into powerful new features of SAP HANA itself. Students will learn how to use SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA or SAP Web IDE full-stack to develop both HDI and XSA-based applications for SAP HANA on-premise or on SAP Business Technology Platform.

We’ll also focus on real-world problems and opportunities such as:
- Cross-container and external reporting tool access to containers
- Realistic yet easier-to-maintain security setup
- The power of modern programming models
- SQL DDL-based database object creation
- New Core Data & Servces concepts for service enablement and UI annotations
- More open source components and techniques

## Course Content
Week 1: What’s New in SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 03

Week 2: New Programming Model

Week 3: Open Technologies and Concepts

Week 4: Final Exam

## Target Audience
Application developers
SAP HANA developers
SAP BTP developers

## Course Requirements
Basic programming knowledge including HTML, JavaScript, and SQL
Baseline SAP HANA development knowledge from one of the previous SAP HANA courses on openSAP would be helpful

## Development Systems
If your primary interest in taking this course is getting an overview of software development on SAP HANA, you do not need access to a training system. However, we realize that many of you will be interested in completing the hands-on exercises based on the instructions in the course. We’ll therefore provide the necessary instructions and installation procedures in the respective units.

The exercises in this course are primarily designed so that you can execute them on an SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 03-based SAP HANA, express edition system (of a patch level from October 2018 or newer - minimum: XSA Runtime (1.0.97) and SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA (4.3.57)).
